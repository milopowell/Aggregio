### Why?

---

Aggregio was created because of an issue I faced after going on a 3-day backpacking trip with my cousin. I had recorded multiple "hiking" workouts on my Apple Watch to my Strava, but I couldn't figure out a good way to view all the activities at once. Therefore, in order to view all the acitvities at once, I created Aggregio.

Feel free to use the service for all your workout aggregating needs! Some ideas for usage include marathon training visualization, bike-packing journeys across the world, and swim workouts in the ocean.
